This is a file with thoughts on what should be implemented and for what version.
This list is likely to change, no guarantees what so ever.

1.1
Config won't work if enabled is changed before configurating (wrong orig path for contents)
Icons for dazips
Remember contents in item main path
Contents conflict check.

Future
Allow new addins to be created, empty or with unknown files.
Keep track of files added or removed from the folders while running.
Recreate dazip from addin (requires a zip writing lib).
